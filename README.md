These documents are from my time as the Florida Data and Program Manager for America Votes during the 2020 election cycle. 
They cover a wide variety of projects and small tasks conducted in R. The largest of these projects was the compiling of daily early vote and vote-by-mail totals - analyzing them for topline reporting, manipulating them for VAN uploads, and preparing them for Tableau to share out daily updates in a dashboard.

Each .R file will have a detailed explanation at the beginning that will include the file's purpose and what files were used throughout the code. 

Please reach out if you have any questions regarding this code. This repo is mostly for my personal storage, but I hope it may help anyone who happens upon it to decipher all there is to find in Florida's election data.  My contact info is jenna.tingum@gmail.com - email with any questions or comments. 

Thanks to Dillon Boatner who developed similar code in Stata and helped me develop many of these files and Michael Brenner who mentored me throughout this election cycle.
